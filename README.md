### Cobblemon Multi Platform Template
With this template you can easily make side-mods for [Cobblemon](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon), all you need is to fork this template and start modding.

There is some settings that you'll need to change. (Basically rename some variables from your_mod_id to your mod id, and same for name, description, etc)\
You can find this settings in: `settings.gradle.kts` and `gradle.properties`

GitHub will always compile all push events into an artifact, but you can also fire your own release action in **GitHub actions** > **[Release](https://github.com/Rafacasari/Cobblemon-Template/actions/workflows/release.yml)**

I'm not giving support or modding tutorials, this is just a resource that I'm sharing. Issues about this template can be reported in the [Issues](https://github.com/Rafacasari/Cobblemon-Template/issues) page.

### Other plans
I'll probably also be updating this template with some implementations that should make cross-platform development easier. Like server command registration, client command registration and more.
